            <figcaption>Figure 1: Two grocery store (Woolworths) chickens, one without antibiotics and growth hormones and one with. 2024. Photograph by author.</figcaption>
            <p>Figure 1 depicts two supermarket chickens; however, one is advertised as routine antibiotic and growth stimulant free while the other one is not. The use of routine antibiotics and growth stimulants are both damaging to the chicken and potentially damaging to humans as it is consumed. The objective of broiler chicken production is to create and sell as much chicken as possible with the lowest possible costs associated with the process (Four Paws 2023). One method this aim is achieved is through antibiotics and stimulants that cause fast growth rates in chickens and can negatively affect their health, causing lameness and heart conditions (Compassion in World Farming [sa]). The death rates in broiler chickens is high at 5-7.5%, 30% of the chickens are injured upon arrival at slaughter and majority of them cannot walk properly (Four Paws 2023). In addition, it causes long-term effects in humans as it can contribute to antibiotic resistance in human infections, which could potentially render antibiotics useless in the future (Compassion in World Farming [sa]).  Woolworths confirms that only its free-range chickens are substance-free (Woolworths [sa]), highlighting issues of food security as the more sustainable, less artificially modified chickens are more expensive and less accessible to lower-income people. This is a harmful cycle that is perpetuated through chicken consumption and inequality. This practice is anthropocentric in nature, placing the needs of people above the chickens (Steffen et al 2011:843). The ethics behind these practices are non-existent and core values and good ethics need to be implemented within the poultry industry to prevent destruction (O’ Gorman 2019:428). Revisions need to be made to the pricing of free-range meat and the poultry industry needs to be reworked so that chickens are farmed in ethical manners and taken care of properly in their lifetimes. </p>

                The hadada is feeling gloom
                In the bin, it searches for food
                This is its reality, harsh and rude
                A takeaway box constitutes food.
                
                Figure 2 depicts a hadada eating take-away food containers from the rubbish on the UP campus. Pollution/litter and a hostile environment for animals are highlighted as the bird is eating rubbish instead of being able to find food naturally. Anthropocentric, human-first designs create problems for creatures that were the original inhabitants of these spaces (Palsson et al 2012:4). They are negatively affected as their ecosystem and natural food system is destroyed.  Litter poses a major issue for biodiversity as animals eating it can face lethal consequences (Mahato & Pal 2021:146). Habitat loss and degradation are threats to birds in South Africa, with two of the key factors being pollution and industrial expansion (Bird Life South Africa [sa]).  A disregard for proper disposal of rubbish and expansion leads to these issues. This photograph aims to bring awareness to garbage disposal and anthropocentric design and the ways in which it can damage biodiversity and kill off animals that lived there. It calls for correct disposal of litter and design that ensures animal’s safety, such as placing lids on outdoor bins, correctly disposing of litter and placing an emphasis on the inclusion of animals when designing built up environments. The approach of environmental humanities may be taken, and cautions taken to protect and uplift (O’ Gorman 2019:428), while co-existing with the wildlife in shared spaces.

            <p>Just keep swimming” – Dory
                Something is out of place here. A lobster, far away from the coast where a lobster should be, taken out of its natural habitat and stowed in a car. Fishing practices and pollution take animals out of their natural environment, cause population damage and can lead to extinction slowly (Nixon 2011:3). Figure 3 depicts a lobster on the dashboard of a car. It has been taken out of its natural environment for the sake of a car decoration. Seafood is linked with the South African coast, whether it is a fish braai or as a job industry for many people, it is critical to the country. Unsustainable fish farming and fishing threaten this narrative in the age of the Anthropocene (WWF/SASSI [sa]). The removal of the lobster from its environment into an environment that is clearly not meant for it shows the dangers of anthropocentric thought and the ease of access to animals from the fishing industry. The car highlights the dangers of human impact and carbon emissions on animals. South Africa is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter in Africa, with 405 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2022 (Cartrack [sa]). Much of this can be attributed to SA being the highest CO2 producer in transport (ESI Africa [sa). The impact of these emissions is harmful to the environment and especially to animals. Animals and ecosystems are damaged due to emissions due to human impact and are in a sense, trapped (like the lobster in the car) as there is nothing, they can do about it (Kolbert 2014: [sp]). It is difficult for marine life to “just keep swimming” when there are this many obstacles in their way that humans have put there.

            <p>Water is the essence of life, from the plants to the fish in the ocean to the animals that inhabit the earth, it is critical to survival and life. If water becomes scarce or compromised, the days of living organisms are numbered. This is the new reality that is faced due to a lack of care and the slow buildup of negligence in waste disposal (Nixon 2011:3). Figure 4 depicts a “pure” water bottle of spring water that has been mixed with face scrub to illustrate how face wash going down the drains and plastic pollution ends up in drinking water.  Microplastics have been discovered in water that was once thought to be safe and pure. Microplastics are plastic fragments that are too small to be seen with the naked eye and that are derived from primary sources (cosmetics, cleaning products, medical supplies and industrial materials) and secondary sources (large plastic materials that are prone to degradation over time) (Swanepoel et al 2023:320). While the World Health Organization deems microplastics within drinking water as a low concern, at the rate in which plastic production is speeding up and becoming more prevalent within society, with 33 billion tons of plastic produced estimated in 2050 (Swanepoel et al 2023:320), it is a growing concern that should not be swept away and left unchecked and turn into a health crisis (Nixon 2011:3). The contamination of water with plastic is a cycle within South Africa. The oceans and marine life are compromised by plastic pollution (Fadare et al 2021: 1). Just as water is not safe coastally, nor is it safe to drink by humans and land animals. Water is the essence of life, and this essence of life is actively threatened due to human’s wasteful ways. Attention needs to be paid to litter disposal, ocean cleanup and water filtration to create safe water for all creatures that require it for life, otherwise the consequences may be dire.</p>

            <p>You are what you eat. And what is it that we eat? Food of course, but is that all? Unbeknown to most, it is not all we eat. Studies have shown microplastics within the foods consumed by humans. Figure 5 depicts a traditionally South African meal of boerewors and pap, seasoned with Styrofoam “salt’ at a place setting with a shaker of Styrofoam “salt’ next to it. Microplastics and particles have been found to be present within African table salt, with South Africa having the highest concentration of microplastics in salt at 0-1.333 MP/kg (Fadare et al 2021: 6). Microplastics are present within our foods unknown to the consumer and can cause potentially life-threatening health implications. It is not only salt that poses an issue, microplastics can be found in 86% in fish caught off the South African coastline (Sparks & Immelman 2020: 3). Microplastics are found within the food that is consumed both by humans and by animals and are damaging to everyone. Microplastics are a human invention and the spread of them is caused through littering, unrecyclable objects and a lack of care paid to the environment. The ocean is full of microplastics, with plastic pollution being the greatest proportion of marine litter (Fadare et al 2021: 1). It is due to this that fish become full of microplastics and the processes that make salt, which takes salt from the ocean, causes it to become full of microplastics. The ocean is full of them, and salt is made from the ocean, so in turn, it becomes filled with microplastics too. The ocean is no longer a safe place for the creatures that inhabit it (Kolbert 2014: [sp]). This carelessness now affects all creatures, and action must be taken to rectify this, such as recycling and ocean clean-ups and the abandonment of single-use plastics so that creatures do not have microplastics in their bodies. </p>
